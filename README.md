# Smart_Barrier_System
Smart barrier system utilizes Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, red/green LEDs. Ultrasonic sensor detects vehicles, Arduino controls servo motor to lift barrier (green LED), lowers when no vehicles (red LED). Streamlines traffic flow with efficient automation and clear visual indicators.
